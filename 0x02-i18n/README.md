# i18n (Internationalization)

This project focuses on internationalization (i18n) in Flask, which involves making your web application accessible to users from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. It aims to teach you how to parametrize Flask templates to display content in different languages, infer the correct locale based on various factors such as URL parameters, user settings, or request headers, and localize timestamps to suit the user's preferred language and format.

Flask-Babel is an extension to Flask that adds i18n and l10n support to any Flask application with help of babel, pytz, and speaklater.

## Techniques and Definitions

### Internationalization (i18n):

Internationalization is the process of designing and developing software in a way that makes it adaptable to different languages and cultures without engineering changes. It typically involves parameterizing text and other locale-specific elements in the application, allowing them to be easily translated and localized for different target audiences.

### Flask Templates Parametrization:

Parametrizing Flask templates involves separating the static content of the templates from the dynamic parts that may vary depending on the user's locale or other factors. This allows for easy substitution of text and other content based on the chosen language or locale.

### Locale Inference:

Locale inference refers to the process of determining the appropriate locale or language settings for a user based on various contextual factors. This can include analyzing URL parameters, user preferences stored in settings, or extracting information from request headers sent by the user's browser.

### Localization of Timestamps:

Localization of timestamps involves converting timestamp data into a format that is appropriate for the user's locale. This includes translating month names, day names, and adjusting the date and time format based on the conventions of the user's language and region.

By mastering these techniques and understanding the key definitions, you will be equipped to create web applications that cater to a global audience, providing a seamless and personalized experience for users regardless of their language or cultural background.
