# Queuing System in JS

This project demonstrates how to implement a queuing system in JavaScript using Redis and Kue.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Redis server
- Node.js

## How to Run Redis Server on Your Machine

1. Install Redis on your machine if you haven't already.
2. Run the Redis server using the appropriate command for your operating system.

## How to Run Simple Operations with the Redis Client

To run simple operations with the Redis client, follow these steps:

1. Install the Redis client for your preferred programming language.
2. Connect to the Redis server.
3. Execute basic operations such as setting and getting values.

## How to Use a Redis Client with Node.js for Basic Operations

To use a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations, follow these steps:

1. Install the Redis client library for Node.js.
2. Connect to the Redis server.
3. Perform basic operations like setting and getting values using the client.

## How to Store Hash Values in Redis

To store hash values in Redis, follow these steps:

1. Use the appropriate command to create a hash.
2. Set key-value pairs within the hash.

## How to Deal with Async Operations with Redis

When dealing with async operations with Redis, make sure to use the asynchronous versions of client methods and handle callbacks or promises accordingly.

## How to Use Kue as a Queue System

To use Kue as a queue system, follow these steps:

1. Install Kue using npm or yarn.
2. Create a queue instance.
3. Add jobs to the queue and process them asynchronously.

## How to Build a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server

To build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server, follow these steps:

1. Set up an Express app.
2. Connect to the Redis server from within the Express app.
3. Implement routes and handlers to interact with Redis.

## How to Build a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server and Queue

To build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server and queue, follow these steps:

1. Set up an Express app.
2. Connect to both Redis server and Kue queue.
3. Implement routes and handlers to interact with Redis and process jobs from the queue.
